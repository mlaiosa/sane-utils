Mike's Poorly Polished SANE Tools
=================================

These are some things I've hacked together over the years for using SANE.

scanpdf
-------

scanpdf is a command line utility for scanning things and producing a PDF.  It
takes an irritatingly complex Rube Goldberg of tools in order to get the final
PDF to have the right DPI.


scanweb
-------

A simple web interface that wraps scanpdf, so that people in my family who are
allergic to the command prompt can scan too.  Its not designed to be secure,
and I don't bill myself as a very good web developer; please don't judge me by
this too harshly.
